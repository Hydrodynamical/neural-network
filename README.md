# Introduction

This project is devoted to making a neural network architecture with minimal library requirements in Python. For CPU only support, only the math package and NumPy will be used. For GPU support, I plan to use CuPy instead of NumPy (this requires a CUDA supported GPU).

See the PDF labeled "Neural Networks: Overview" for the basics of neural networks, from a mathematical perspective.
